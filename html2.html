    <h2>Early Years</h2>

    <p>During the 1980s, each of the future members of Tool moved to Los Angeles. Both Paul D'Amour and Adam Jones wanted
        to enter the film industry, while Maynard James Keenan found employment remodeling pet stores after having studied
        visual arts in Michigan. Danny Carey and Keenan performed for Green Jellÿ, and Carey played with Carole King

    <h2>The Undertow</h2>

    <p>The following year, at a time when alternative rock and grunge was at its height, Tool released their first
        full-length album, Undertow (1993). It expressed more diverse dynamics than Opiate and included songs the band
        had chosen not to publish on their previous release, when they had opted for a heavier sound.[12] The band began
        touring again as planned, with an exception in May 1993. Tool was scheduled to play at the Garden Pavilion
        in Hollywood but learned at the last minute that the venue belonged to the Church of Scientology, which was
        perceived as a clash with "the band's ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts
        their development as a human being." Keenan "spent most of the show baa-ing like a sheep at the audience."</p>

<h1>Musical style and influence</h1>
<article>
    <p>Tool was described by Patrick Donovan of The Age as "the thinking person's metal band. Cerebral and visceral,
        soft and heavy, melodic and abrasive, tender and brutal, familiar and strange, western and eastern,
        beautiful and ugly, taut yet sprawling and epic, they are a tangle of contradictions.</p>

    <h3>Music style</h3>

    <p>A component of Tool's song repertoire relies on the use of unusual time signatures.</p>

    <h3>Influence</h3>

    <p>The band has named the group Melvins[22] as an influence on its development, but the most-publicized
        influence is progressive rock pioneer group King Crimson.
